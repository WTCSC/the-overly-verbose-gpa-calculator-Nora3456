##  How to run the GPA calculator after opening the program:

1. 👋 | The GPA calculator will give you a welcome message, then ask you how many classes you have. To answer the first question type in the number of classes you have then press enter, **only type numbers**. 
- _**‼️ NOTE:‼️** (for all inputs) If your input to a question is invalid, a message will pop up saying your message was invalid. then the question will repeat itself, give a valid answer._
2. 🤔 | After doing step 1, the GPA calculator will ask you what your grade is in each one of those classes. **Again, only type numbers.** After typing your answer, press enter.
3. 👍👎 | Given your classes and grades, the calculator will display your GPA! It will also follow up with a message saying whether or not your GPA is good. It uses the following grade - level chart to calculate how good/bad your GPA is:
4. 🔍 | After displaying your GPA, the calculator will then ask if you want to focus on your 1st, or 2nd semester GPA. The code does this by splitting your number of classes in half, and then calcualting your GPA on only those classes. If your GPA in your 2nd semester was greater than your overall GPA (all classes), then you will get a congratulative message!
5. 🎯 | Your GPA calculator will ask you what your GOAL GPA is. Input your goal GPA, **Remember to only input numbers**, after inputting your goal GPA, press enter. 
6. 🥳 | If your GOAL GPA is already met, you will get a congratulation message! 
7. ↕️ | **If step 6 does NOT apply to you**, the code will tell you what your new GPA would be if one class grade per cycle was raised to a 4.0. If your lowest classes grade was raised to 4.0, and your goal GPA still wasn't met, then a message will be displayed saying you will need to improve more than one class.
